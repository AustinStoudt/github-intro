# github-intro

Pick one of the files from either the Arduino or Processing directory (folder) and do the following:


1.  Fork this repo: https://github.com/inventioneering/github-intro (short for repository... which is what we call projects in GitHub).  See this for help: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

2.  Pick a file in either the arduino or processing directories (what we call folders in GitHub) and add comments to it.  

3.  Commit your changes (there is a green button at the bottom after that you can press after you've made your changes)

4.  Format your comments like below:
    
    `// this is my example comment.  You can put them anywhere and they get skipped` <br />
    `// by the compiler when you run them on the arduino so it won't affect your code` <br />
   `// at all.  We use them so humans better understand code machines just ignore them.` <br />
