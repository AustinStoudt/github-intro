# github-intro

Pick one of the files from either the Arduino or Processing directory (folder) and do the following:


1.  Copy the whole thing
2.  Create a new file in this directory named, "LastName_FileName.ino"
3.  Add comments to that code explaining what it does.  You add comments to Arduino and Processing by simply 
    writing a line of code with two "//" in front of it... see the next line for an example
    
    `// this is my example comment.  You can put them anywhere and they get skipped by the compiler when you
    // run them on the arduino so it won't affect your code at all.  We use them so humans better understand code
    // machines just ignore them.`
    
4.  Create an issue to let me know its done and you'd like me to check it.
